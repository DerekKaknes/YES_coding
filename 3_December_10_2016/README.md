# Lesson 3 - Intro to Classes and Review of Functions
Welcome back to **_YES Coding!_**  After a break for Thanksgiving and some brain
dissection, I'm looking forward to getting back into some Python!  In the last
two lessons, we have covered `strings` and `functions`, as well as some basic python
syntax.  You may feel a little bit rusty on those topics after the two week
absence, but don't worry - today will be part review and part new material.  Our
focus today is on the concept of [Object-Oriented
Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).
Object-oriented programming is a big concept, but we are going to get our feet
wet with the initial concepts of `classes` and `objects`.
## Beginner - Introduction to Python Classes
Your objectives today are as follows:

1. Read through this introduction and work through (in discussion with others)
the coding problems that are presented;
2. Complete the codecademy course linked to at the end of this section;
3. Attempt as many of the coding challengs in `beginner_classes.py` as you feel
comfortable with.

### Introduction to Classes and OOP
Last lesson, we built some fuctions that could be useful in the future, like
`cube` and `one_good_turn`, and we also learned how to load those function
using `from ____ import ____`.  Ordering and combining several functions into a
single set of commands is one way to organize your code (often called
**Functional Programming**), but a different - and very common - way of
organizing your code is through **Objects**.  In Python, we create `objects`
from `classes`.  A `class` is pretty simple - it is a group of abilities or
attributes that are shared by a type of object.  It is most easily demonstrated
through examples:

My first car was a Toyota Avalon.  My car is one of thousands (maybe
millions) of Toyota Avalons that exist in the world, but each of them shares
common traits and abilities: they are the same size, have the same number
wheels, can drive forward and backward, can reach the same top speed at the
same accelleration, etc.  Thus, my car is an `instance` of the
Toyota Avalon `class`.  There might be millions of `instances` (millions of
individual Toyota Avalon cars), but they are all of the same `class`.

In a sports video game (like FIFA or Madden or NBA2K), there is usually an
option to create a player.  If you choose to create a player, they will often
give you the ability to adjust and customize specific attributes like the
player's height, weight, hairstyle, uniform style, etc.  Each player you create
is an `instance` of the `class` Player.  You can create hundreds of instances,
but they are all of the single Player class.
