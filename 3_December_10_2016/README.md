# Lesson 3 - Intro to Classes and Review of Functions
Welcome back to **_YES Coding!_**  After a break for Thanksgiving and some brain
dissection, I'm looking forward to getting back into some Python!  In the last
two lessons, we have covered `strings` and `functions`, as well as some basic python
syntax.  You may feel a little bit rusty on those topics after the two week
absence, but don't worry - today will be part review and part new material.  Our
focus today is on the concept of [Object-Oriented
Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).
Object-oriented programming is a big concept, but we are going to get our feet
wet with the initial concepts of `classes` and `objects`.
## Beginner - Introduction to Python Classes
Your objectives today are as follows:

1. Read through this introduction and work through (in discussion with others)
the coding problems that are presented;
2. Complete the codecademy course linked to at the end of this section;
3. Attempt as many of the coding challengs in `beginner_classes.py` as you feel
comfortable with.

### Introduction to Classes and OOP
### Codecademy - Python Classes
### Coding Challenges - `beginner_classes.py`
## Advanced - Common Design Patterns: Dependency Injection
