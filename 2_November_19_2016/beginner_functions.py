""" Before moving on, make sure that you understand or ask questions about the
'if' and 'else' statements that you encounter.  These are logical "gates", so you can
read the `if diviosr == 0` as "if the divisor (the bottom number) is equal to zero, then...".
Notice that if/else statements can be super useful for handling different cases and behaviors.
