# Lesson 2 - Working with Functions
Today we are going to learn about functions and how they are used in
programming.  You may be familiar with functions from math - y=f(x) ... - and,
if you are, programmed functions are very similar.  In general, a function is
defined as a set of actions that takes one or more inputs and returns one or
more outputs.
## Beginners - Functions
In python, functions are defined using:
 ```pyton
def name_of_function(inputs):
   # Do stuff
   return output
```


## Intermediate - Markov Sentence Completion

## Expert - Computer Vision: Traffic Light Challenge
See lesson from last week (no one got to it) - or create a text based console
game using stdin and stdout.  For example, Hangman or Black Jack.
