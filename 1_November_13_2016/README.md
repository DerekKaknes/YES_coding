# TITLE
Today we are going to take our first dive into programming with Python.  Some
folks may already be familiar with the Python programming language, while most
of you will not be.  As such, we have three separate coding challenges ranging
in difficulty - I suggest that you pair up with a fellow student who is similar
in coding proficiency and work together to complete your challenges.

##Beginners - Working with Strings
As an intro to programming in python, we are going to start by introducing the
different data types and structures used most frequently.  Most of these types
can be found under the documentation for [Built-In
Types](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html).  The first of those
types will be [Strings
(`str`)](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods), 
which you can think of as sequences of characters (both letters, numbers and
special characters). Read through the documentation and methods for Strings and
then try and complete the first two lessons of
[Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) online python
tutorial.  Once you have completed those lessons - or if you feel up for it
beforehand - try downloading the starter code from this repo (ask Derek if you
have questions) and try to code up a working solution!

##Intermediate - Advanced Strings and Regular Expressions (regex)
One of the most common - and potentially most frustrating - tasks in programming
is to search through a string or list of strings in order to find and/or replace
certain values.  

##Expert - Computer Vision: Traffic Light Challenge
For our first project, we are going to look into using Computer Vision to aid in
a (for now) theoretical robot's decision making.  In this challenge, you are
tasked with developing a program that will process an image from your computer's
webcam and make a decision on whether the color in the image is (predominately)
red, yellow or green.  Based on that determination, your program should inform
your robot to either Stop!, Slow Down!, or Go!, respectively.
